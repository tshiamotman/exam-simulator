      "explanation": "Heat transfers by: (1) Conduction — direct contact between surfaces (e.g., rock to air); (2) Convection — heat carried by moving air/fluid (dominant mechanism in mine airways); (3) Radiation — electromagnetic energy transfer (e.g., from hot rock surfaces); (4) Evaporation — latent heat removed when water evaporates from wet surfaces or skin (critical for human thermoregulation and mine cooling).

The Free State goldfields have rock with higher geothermal heat flux (possibly due to older intrusive bodies or lower thermal conductivity of the rock package), resulting in a steeper temperature gradient with depth.",
